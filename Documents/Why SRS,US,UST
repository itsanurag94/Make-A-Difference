For the development of our project, I would be using Use Cases and User stories. 

I think that Use cases and gives us an agile approach. It helps us to make a weel-planned plan on how to figure what are the functional and what are the non-functional requirements of the application. We are able to know about what all features we need in our application and how to go about implementing all of them. As I could see while developing the Use Case and user stories, I listed many of the system features and interface requirements that I had not listed before. So, in this SCRUM approach, it helps us to go about developing the application perfectly.

On the other hand, for the end users, SRS would be more apt and useful as it gives more detailed information about the application and the users can understand abou the application more aptly.
